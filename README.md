# Heart-Attack-ML

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes of patients. The dataset contains information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors. Machine learning classification techniques are employed to build models for accurate prediction.

## Models
Several machine learning models are trained for heart attack prediction, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like grid search to optimize model performance.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for any improvements, bug fixes, or new features.
